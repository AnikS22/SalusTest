SALUS PAPER STATUS
==================

Last Updated: January 12, 2026

CURRENT STATUS
--------------
✓ Paper structure complete (NeurIPS 2025 format)
✓ All sections written
✓ Main results filled in with actual data
⚠ Some experiments still ongoing
⚠ pdflatex not installed (use Overleaf to compile)

ACTUAL DATA FILLED IN
----------------------
✓ AUROC: 88.3% (vs 50.1% random baseline)
✓ Recall: 51.6%
✓ Precision: 41.2%
✓ False Alarm Rate: 6.4%
✓ Model size: 70,672 parameters (284 KB)
✓ Dataset: 5,000 episodes, 1M timesteps
✓ Training time: ~2 hours (100 epochs)

PLACEHOLDERS (TBD)
------------------
[TBD] - Inference latency (needs benchmarking)
[Ongoing] - Ablation study (currently running but taking too long)
[Pending] - Multi-horizon analysis (needs per-horizon metrics)

KNOWN ISSUES
------------
⚠ Signal extraction has bugs: 75% of signals return NaN
  - Only 3/12 signals work correctly (action magnitude, trajectory divergence, latent drift)
  - This is documented in the limitations section

⚠ Ablation study taking ~5 days (something wrong with setup)
  - Should only take ~4-5 hours
  - Need to debug or restart with fewer epochs

TO COMPILE
----------
Option 1: Install LaTeX locally
  sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-base texlive-latex-extra
  ./compile_simple.sh

Option 2: Use Overleaf (recommended)
  1. Go to overleaf.com
  2. Upload salus_paper.tex and neurips_2025.sty
  3. Compile online

TRUTHFULNESS NOTE
-----------------
The paper is honest about:
✓ Simulation-only evaluation (no real robot)
✓ Signal extraction bugs (documented in limitations)
✓ Ongoing experiments (clearly marked with [TBD] or [Ongoing])
✓ Actual performance numbers (no exaggeration)

The blue-colored text marks sections that are:
- Still being computed
- Known limitations
- Future work items
